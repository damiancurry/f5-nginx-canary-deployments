push out v1 and and run deployment scripts
 - should we automate this as step zero?
 - can this be part of the pipeline?
   - check kubectl to see if demo-app aclready exists?
Push out v2
 - this should be a "clean" deployement
  - Any request coming to the app returns a 200 response code
 - checks pass and everything promotes without error
  - chekcs are hitting /200.html, /400.html, /500.html, which all return 200 status
Push out v3
 - This creates a "bad" build
  - extract uri and return the uri as as the http response call
 - *something* watches for count of 4xx and 5xx errors via promethues(?)
 - roll back and remove v3
 Push out "v4"(v2)
  - 


baseline app is deployed
 demo-app-1 deployment created
 demo-app-svc-1 svc created
 demo.example.com virtual server created
 
deploy v2
 demo-app-2 deployment created
 demo-app-svc-2 svc created
 check demo virtualserver, extract existing config and apply it to template
  - kubectl describe virtualserver demo-app -n f5-nginx-canary-deployments | grep Service
  - if it returns 2 services, must be a running deploy?  then fail and return error
